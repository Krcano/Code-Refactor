# homework-1

In this html file I was able to make a few updates. I first added the alt attributes to the images so that in the case the images don't load properly then at least a concise description of the image will be there. 

I also added the id tag to the search-engine-optimization div so when the viewer presses the link for it it will take them to the right spot on the webpage regarding the search engine heading optimization.
