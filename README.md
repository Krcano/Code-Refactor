Code Refactor

This file is a codebase that i have been working on fixing for a marketing agency to get their site optimized for search engines and so that the codebase follows accessilbility standards.The following changes made on this code will allow for those with disabilities and their assistive technogies to read the site with ease.

 I first added the alt attributes to the images in the html file so that in the case the images don't load properly then at least a concise description of the image will be there. It will also allow for screen readers to describe the image to those who are visually impaired. I added an appropriate and more desriptive title for the site to show on the tab.

I also added an id where the article tag in the search-engine-optimation article so when the viewer presses the link for it it will take them to the right spot on the webpage regarding the search engine optimization heading.

I updated the html file for a more semantic structure by adding a header, foooter, article, section and nav tags throughout to replace the majority of the div tags. I added comments throughout both files to show the purpose of the customizations i made as well.

Along the way i had some issues consolidating the classes because each time i tried to find a solution it broke the code which made me go back to square one. In the end with the help of my collaboraters/classmates we were able to work through it and come up with the finished product by creating a class selector that covers all the content that shared the same customizations. While the code at first was functional in some ways, doing this cleaned it up.
