Code Refactor

This file is a codebase that i have been working on fixing for a marketing agency to get their site optimized for search engines and so that the codebase follows accessilbility standards.

In this html file I was able to make a few updates. I first added the alt attributes to the images so that in the case the images don't load properly then at least a concise description of the image will be there. I added an appropriate title for the site to show on the tab.

I also added the id tag at the article tag for search engine optimation so when the viewer presses the link for it it will take them to the right spot on the webpage regarding the search engine optimization heading.

I update the html file for a more semantic structure by adding a header, foooter, article, section and nav tags throughout to replace the majority of the div tags.

I added comments throughout both files to show the purpose of the customiztions i made  as well.

Along the way i had some issues consolidating the classes because each time i tried to find a solution it broke the code which made me go back to square one but in the end with the help of my collaboraters/classmates we were able to work through it and come up with the finished product.
